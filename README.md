# Storidian
## Assuredly self-hosted (Project in Planning)

## What is Storidian?
Storidian will be an open-source, self-hosted file storage application that puts you in complete control of your digital assets. Built with security and simplicity as core principles, Storidian will empower users to create personal cloud storage solutions without compromising on privacy or functionality.

## Our Mission
We believe your data belongs to you alone. Storidian will provide a robust alternative to corporate cloud services that monetize your information. By creating powerful, accessible self-hosting tools, we aim to build a future where data sovereignty is the norm, not the exception.

## Core Functionality
* **Complete File Management:** Upload, organize, share, and sync files across all your devices
* **Enhanced Security:** End-to-end encryption, granular access controls, and comprehensive audit logging
* **Intuitive Interface:** Modern, responsive design that prioritizes usability without sacrificing power
* **Seamless Integration:** Open APIs and extension capabilities for integration with your existing tools
* **Resource Efficient:** Optimized performance even on modest hardware, making self-hosting accessible
* **Version Control:** Track changes, restore previous versions, and maintain file history
* **Collaborative Tools:** Secure sharing and collaborative editing with permissions you control

## Planned Technical Foundation
Storidian will be built on modern, proven technologies that prioritize security, performance, and maintainability:
* **Backend:** Laravel for a robust PHP framework with excellent ORM, security features, and middleware support
* **Frontend:** Vue.js providing reactive components and a smooth user experience
* **Storage:** Flexible backend supporting local storage, S3-compatible services, and custom providers
* **Authentication:** OAuth2, LDAP integration, and MFA support

## Why Contribute?

As an open-source project, we value:
* Transparent governance and decision-making
* Quality code that's well-tested and maintainable
* Inclusive community where diverse perspectives are welcomed
* Practical solutions that address real user needs

2. You'll be able to review planned features and our roadmap
3. We'll establish community channels
4. We'll publish contributor guidelines

**Storidian**: Your files. Your control. Your peace of mind. (Coming soon)
